## About Me: Empowering Independent Creators (Especially VTubers!)

I'm building tools and offering services to help content creators, particularly VTubers, thrive independently.  I believe in creator ownership and freedom, offering a flexible, freelance-based alternative to traditional talent agencies.  Think of me as your on-demand business assistant â€“ you keep control, and I handle the tasks you need help with.

**My Focus:**

*   **Bridging Language Barriers:** I'm developing tools like a Twitch Extension for real-time translation of donations and messages, connecting creators with their global audiences.
*   **Streamlining Monetization:**  I help set up and manage platforms like Fourthwall, handling merchandise design and shop branding, so creators can focus on what they do best: creating.
* **True Independence:** My model is based on providing value. I work on a freelance basis, taking a percentage of the money only where I create value, ensuring creators retain full ownership of their content and IP.

**Current Projects:**

*   Twitch Extension: Live, multi-lingual donation/message translation.
*   Fourthwall Setup & Management: Helping VTubers launch and run successful merch stores.

I'm passionate about empowering the next generation of independent creators.  Let's build something amazing together!
